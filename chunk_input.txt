in Fact
I’am name and i am twelve years old. I live in place. My room is upstairs and it is verry small. I have two windows, a bed, a mirror, a desk, a cher, a closet and another desk. My mirror is next to my closet, my cher is between my bed and desk, and my other desk is behind my bed. I keep my clothes in a closet and i chere it with my sister.  My favourite thing in my room is my bed because it lays very comfrontal. I don’t realy like my closet becaus it is verry big. I clean my room self becaus nobody els want to do it. I clean is evry month. My room is verry small but i do like it.
